An untested PCB design for an FPGA shield to interface with multiple microcontrollers over SPI is available in the repo. This shield is designed for the [QMTech Cyclone V 5CEFA2 Core Development Board](https://github.com/ChinaQMTECH/QM_CYCLONE_V/tree/master/5CEFA2F23), and is very unlikely to work on other development boards.

- Header for OLED display, selectable source via jumpers
- Additional SPI headers
- I2C headers, with optional pull-up resistors
- Onboard 3.3V power supply
